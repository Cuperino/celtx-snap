# Celtx

Celtx is a full-feature scriptwriting application and a set of media pre-production tools designed to ease the work of those who work in the media production industry by providing a simple desktop utility for organizing the project information and making stories come alive. The application comes with all the necessary tools for writing scripts, plays, novels without using the pen and the paper.

This legacy desktop software has been discontinued and is no longer supported or officially available. Here is the Linux binary for version 2.9.7 (probably the last version ever released) and the YAML file used to build its Snap package.

"Celtx" is an acronym for Crew, Equipment, Location, Talent and XML.
